This project involves the design and development of a blockchain-based certificate validation system using smart contracts and distributed ledger technology.
The system will enable academic institutions to issue digital certificates as unique, tamper-proof records stored on the blockchain.through consensus mechanisms. 
The integrity and authenticity of certificates can be verified by relevant stakeholders, including potential employers, academic institutions, and certificate holders.
